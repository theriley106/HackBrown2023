 Who of those would be a telegram? Nobody knows what a telegram is anymore, because we don't use them. Who just did that? No, I wanna know. Stand up. We'll stay here until either that person admits who it is or the person sitting around them tells me who it is. Who was it? Nobody knows? It was back here. I've been hearing it in this room like regularly. And I'm not sure I believe that. Let me tell you something, you guys. My bad side is as bad as my pleasant side is pleasant. All right, don't push me that way. I like to keep things informal in here as much as possible, but understand where the difference between informal and in polite is. And I won't tolerate in polite. If I hear one more of these overly loud yawns, get up and walk the hell out. Yawn outside. Stay out of class. Whatever it is you need to do to get over it. I wanna know why 220 other people in this room don't find the need to do that. And you should be asking yourself, why am I the one loser that has to do that? At 220 other people, no better. Don't push me to this point again. All right, now if that didn't ruin the tone for the rest of the class, by the way, if somebody wants to anonymously tell me who it is, please do. All right. A kilobite.
